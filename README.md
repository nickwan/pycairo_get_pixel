# pycairo_get_pixel
This is sort of an ugly version of PIL's getpixel() function. There are two versions in the notebook, a PIL version and a pycairo-only version. For some reason, the PIL version is less accurate. Unsure why. The pycairo-only version works well, but it's pretty slow compared to the PIL version.
